# Elevator-System
Embedded Real-time Systems Course Final Project
The elevator system first models in Matlab-Simulink and these models are in elevator.slx file.

Then we get the automatic generated code by Matlab and add some C codes to implement the code directly on Arduino board. 

Finally we simulate the system in TinkerCad.

You can see the Simulation results in Aparat in following link:
